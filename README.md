# notion2jekyll

Thanks for being my sponsor!

This repository contains code that I use to synchronize my notion database with https://blog.korge.org/ and https://soywiz.com/.

Please, feel free to use it yourself in your own projects or grab code as you need, but please, do not distribute it or fork it, since this is for sponsors :)

Thanks!
